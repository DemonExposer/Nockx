# Nockx™

Nockx™ (like Fort Knox) is a secure chat application.
It uses 256-bit AES encryption to exchange messages and audio. AES, being a symmetric algorithm, can only be used with both the sender and the receiver having the same key. For this reason, the AES key, for each message or voice call, is encrypted using a 2048-bit RSA key, unique to each user. Messages and requests are also verified with the RSA key to ensure data integrity.<br/>
Messages are stored on a server (closed-source), to make sure that the messages and keys are separated.<br/>

<strong>Note: because Nockx™ is still in pre-release, the aforementioned description MIGHT NOT BE CORRECT. This is only an indication of how the software will function when it is released!</strong>
